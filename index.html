<h2>Preamble</h2>
A country is an organization that provides security and order within a territory by monopolizing violence.

Until Bitcoin, the responsibility of minting currency fell to the country because it was able to enforce anti-counterfeiting with its agents.

The word 'country' is used here instead of 'state' because this document proposes a severing of the state into two pieces: the country and the network.

The country deals with a specific set of territory. The network deals with the interactions within a population.

The network manages the currency and therefore, the economy. It's able to do this using a mathematical consensus mechanism that does not require threat of violence to prevent counterfeiting. (double spends)

This living document defines the structure of the network's human organizations.

<h3>Fall of the country</h3>
The advances in communication and transportation technologies have deterritorialized society to a point where location is much less important since so much value is derived from information alone.

<h2>Legislative Branch</h2>
<em>Planning for the future</em>

The currency's distribution will be dispensed by a series of smart contracts controlled by the members of the legislature.

The legislative body may accept any entity as member. Existing members are expected to organize an onboarding process in order to select new members.

The legislative branch's contracts may perform the following classes of actions:
<ul><li>Minting tokens - Creating coupons with their own trade rules
<li>Burning tokens - Removing coupons from circulation
<li>Token transfers - Theft/lost keys recourse</ul>
